          A gym, short for gymnasium (pl.: gymnasiums or gymnasia), is an indoor
          venue for exercise and sports. The word is derived from the ancient
          Greek term "gymnasion".[1] They are commonly found in athletic and
          fitness centres, and as activity and learning spaces in educational
          institutions. "Gym" is also the commonly used name for a "fitness
          centre" or health club, which is often an area for indoor recreation.
          A "gym" may include or describe adjacent open air areas as well. In
          Western countries, "gyms" often describe places with indoor or outdoor
          courts for basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with
          equipment and machines used for physical development training, or to
          do exercises. In many European countries, Gymnasium (and variations of
          the word) also can describe a secondary school that prepares students
          for higher education at a university, with or without the presence of
          athletic courts, fields, or equipment.

          <p>The chest fly machine also provides greater stability and requires less involvement from the core and stabilising muscles from free weight flyes, allowing a heavier load to be lifted, while ensuring the right muscles are engaged, for optimal strength and hypertrophy gains.
